Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the systematic use of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables creation and maintenance of software applications and systems that are used to power various aspects of modern life such as communication. An instance is the development of mobile applications that are used in communication such as Facebook.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The development of programming languages:  These early programming languages like Fortran and COBOL(C) made coding easier and more accessible, allowing developers to write software more efficiently.
2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline:  In the late 1960s, software engineering became recognized as its own field, that now focused on structured methods to design, develop, and maintain software.
3.The arrival of structured programming: Structured programming introduced clear, organized code using loops and conditionals, making software easier to read, write, and maintain.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements: This is where we gather and document user needs, this may include the solution that they want to develop a software solution for, its design and other components such as cost, and system requirements.
2.Design:  In this stage we create high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation: In this stage, we write code and build the software according to the specifications we gathered in the design phase.
4. Testing: we subject the software to various tests to determine any flaws and to ensure that it meets the quality standards and the functional requirements- that is, it is performing all the functions seamlessly without bugs or crushing.
5.Deployment: After testing and ensuring that it meets all the standards, the software is released to its users.
6.Maintenance: This is an ongoing stage, we provide continuous support, updates and enhancements to the software after it has been deployment to ensure a consistent, continuous proper functioning of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It’s great for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, while Agile is an iterative approach with continuous feedback and adaptation. It’s ideal for projects with changing requirements, like developing a mobile app where user needs may evolve.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing the code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of the software through designing and executing test plans.
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivering of the sofware projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's  are useful and important in providing comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and writing code. Examples of IDEs are Eclipse, Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA
Version Control Systems in important in the tracking of changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, and example is Git and Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Evolving Requirements: Changes in requirements during development can lead to scope expansion and delays.
Strict Deadlines: The need to meet tight deadlines can cause rushed work, potentially lowering the quality of the software.
Technical Debt: Accumulating technical debt from quick fixes or less-than-ideal solutions can slow down future progress and raise maintenance expenses.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Checks individual parts (units) of the software, like functions or methods, to ensure they work correctly. It's the first step in catching bugs early.
Integration Testing: After unit testing, this checks if different parts of the software work well together. It helps find issues in how parts connect.
System Testing: Tests the entire software as a whole to make sure it meets all the requirements. It’s important for ensuring everything works together as expected.
Acceptance Testing: The final test to see if the software meets the user’s needs. It’s important because it determines if the software is ready for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting specific questions or instructions to get the best possible responses from AI models. It’s important because the way you ask something can greatly affect the quality and accuracy of the AI’s answer. Good prompt engineering helps ensure the AI understands what you need and gives you useful information.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a vage prompt:    Write something about marketing
Improved promt: As an experience teacher, write a short guide on how to maintain good hygiene, the guide should be easy to understand and follow along, this guide is to be used by kindergaten children, the guide should also include the risks of not keeping good hygiene with animated illustrations for a clearer message.
